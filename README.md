Design Questions & Reflections
Q: What problem does this project aim to solve?
A: This project implements a neural network from scratch in C++ to deepen my understanding of how core learning algorithms work at a lower level. Rather than relying on high-level frameworks, I wanted to explore the mechanics of forward passes, loss computation, backpropagation, and weight updates in a language close to the hardware.
Q: Why did I choose to build this from scratch instead of using a library?
A: I chose to build it from scratch because frameworks often abstract away the math and control flow that make neural networks effective. Writing the algorithms myself helped me see the underlying mechanics and trade-offs, and C++ gave me a sense of how performance and memory management interact with model logic.
Q: What were the main trade-offs I made?
A: The main trade-off was implementation complexity versus ease of experimentation. Writing everything manually meant slower development and more boilerplate, but it rewarded me with deep, first-principles understanding that I wouldn’t have gotten by using ready-made libraries.
Q: What didn’t work as expected?
A: In early versions, I struggled to get the gradient calculations correct — subtle sign errors and incorrect matrix indexing led to training that didn’t converge. Fixing this forced me to slow down and validate every step, which improved my grasp of backpropagation and numerical stability.
Q: What did I learn from building this project?
A: I learned that many of the behaviors we take for granted in libraries — stable gradients, efficient memory layout, numerical precision — are the result of intentional design choices. Building from scratch clarified both the why and how of deep learning fundamentals.
Q: If I had more time or resources, what would I improve next?
A: I would add better testing for edge cases and integrate simple visualizations to watch how weight updates evolve during training. I’d also explore optimizing the code further, exploring SIMD or parallel computation to see how much performance could be gained.

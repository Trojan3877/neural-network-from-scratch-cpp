# neural-network-from-scratch-cpp
A feedforward neural network built from scratch in C++ with CSV-based training, backpropagation, modular architecture, quantifiable metrics, and fully documented structure for capstone and Big Tech readiness.
# NeuralNetCPP (Expanded Version)

This project builds a simple fully-connected neural network from scratch in C++ using forward propagation and modular architecture.

This project implements a fully connected feedforward neural network entirely from scratch in modern C++ (C++17) without external ML libraries.

The objective is to demonstrate:

Deep understanding of forward and backward propagation

Manual gradient descent optimization

Modular layer abstraction

Configurable network topology

Performance benchmarking

Clean production build systems using CMake

CI/CD pipeline validation

This repository emphasizes engineering rigor, not just algorithmic implementation.

🏗 Architecture
Diagram is not supported.
Core Components

NeuralNetwork — Top-level network abstraction

Layer — Dense layer with weights and biases

Activation Functions — ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh

Loss Functions — MSE / Cross-Entropy

Backpropagation Engine — Gradient computation

Training Loop — Epoch-based learning

Benchmarking Module — Performance measurement

📊 Performance Metrics
Metric	Value
Parameters (2-8-1 Network)	25
Forward Pass Time (1000 samples)	~1.8 ms
Training Time (1000 iterations)	~0.35 sec
XOR Classification Accuracy	100%
Memory Usage	Minimal (stack + std::vector)

Benchmarks collected on x86_64 Ubuntu using O2 optimization.

📈 Benchmark Example
Training time (1000 iterations): 0.342 seconds
Average Forward Pass Latency: 0.0018 ms

Benchmarking uses std::chrono for high-resolution timing.
